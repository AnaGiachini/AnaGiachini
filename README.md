I believe programming gives me the freedom to travel and visit different parts of the world as well as be independent. I am a full stack developer with extensive experience in both backend and frontend and I love that my work is always different. 
I was born and grew up in Argentina, but now Iâ€™m living in Denmark.I love to travel, especially because I can meet, learn and open my mind. I enjoy making each solution developed unique, creative and custom. I am always working on myself. I work every day on my English skills, new technologies and different projects.
I get on well with people and always I am in a good mood,I value good communication and the possibility of continuous learning.

ðŸ”ˆ English level: B1.
